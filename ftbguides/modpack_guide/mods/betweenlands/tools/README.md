Once you have found yourself in either a Coarse Islands, Patchy Islands, or Swamplands biome, you should start looking for two types of trees in particular. The primary one you should find is the §aWeedwood Tree,§r which contains wood that can be turned into planks to act as an alternative to normal wood from the Overworld. The vines growing around the smaller trees are Poison Ivy; you should avoid these vines as they will poison you should you touch them. The second tree you should look for is the §aSap Tree, §rwhich when mined drop §aBalls of Sap §rthat can be used as a primary §eDecay bar §rrestoration source; these balls of sap can also be found in pots and chests.
