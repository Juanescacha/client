There are certain items that you should not take into the dimension. You should not take any food or potions from the Overworld, for once you enter the dimension all non-Betweenlands food and potions (sans Rotten Flesh, which is itself unsustainable) will turn into §aRotten Food §rand §aTainted Potions §rrespectively, which are far from sustainable. Do not take any torches, for attempting to place them in the dimension will cause them to turn into §aDamp Torches,§r which do not provide light. A decent weapon should be brought inside, but nothing particularly valuable, for weapons not from the dimension are diminished in effectiveness when inside. For example, a Diamond Sword while in the Betweenlands is not even as good as a Weedwood Sword from the dimension. Clocks, Compasses, Beds, and Flint and Steel will not function here either, and thus should not be brought.

When you first enter, you will want to realize your surroundings. If you spawn in either a §5Deep Waters §ror §5Sludge Plains §rbiome, it is highly advised to get out of there as soon as possible. Not only do both biomes lack the necessary materials to get started, but the Deep Waters contain schools of hungry Anglers and the Sludge Plains contain multiple different and rather powerful creatures that should not be fought until proper equipment has been obtained.
